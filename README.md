BIN lookup library in Swift.

BINList is a simple library for searching Issuer Identification Numbers (IIN). The first 6 digits of a credit card number are known as the Issuer Identification Number (IIN), previously known as Bank Identification Number (BIN). These identify the institution that issued the card to the card holder.

This library queries Binlist.net's public REST API.
